Collaboration is at the core of Tribe's functionality. Harnessing the power of GPT integration, our platform enables seamless communication, knowledge sharing, and problem-solving. Whether it's brainstorming ideas, discussing projects, or seeking expert advice, Tribe empowers your team to collaborate effortlessly and efficiently.

Finding relevant information has never been easier. Tribe's AI-powered Media & Docs Search feature intelligently scans and indexes your files, making it a breeze to locate the exact document, image, or video you need, precisely when you need it. No more wasted time sifting through endless folders or scrolling through countless chat threads.

Communication is made simple with Tribe's Channels & Direct Message capabilities. Create dedicated channels for specific projects, departments, or topics, ensuring relevant discussions stay organized and accessible. Need to have a quick one-on-one conversation? Tribe's Direct Message feature allows you to connect with team members instantly.

Take your conversations to the next level with audio call support for up to 50 people. Whether it's team meetings, client calls, or cross-department collaborations, Tribe's audio call feature facilitates seamless communication. And with our innovative audio call transcription, aptly named Wave, you can revisit important discussions and easily extract valuable insights.

Efficiency is key, which is why Tribe offers features such as summarizing audio meeting calls, managing and creating notes, tagging messages for follow-up, and bookmarking important messages. With Tribe, you can optimize your workflow, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks and important information is always at your fingertips.

Tribe takes pride in its superior speed and performance, surpassing competitors like Slack and Microsoft Teams. Say goodbye to lagging interfaces and sluggish response times. With Tribe, you'll experience lightning-fast communication and unparalleled efficiency.

Tribe's AI capabilities extend beyond collaboration. With auto-suggestion and completion, our platform helps you save time by intelligently predicting your next actions, streamlining your workflow, and reducing repetitive typing. Additionally, you can schedule messages in advance, ensuring your team stays informed, even when you're not available.

In addition to collaboration features, Tribe offers Stories - a private social media platform for your team. Share important information, updates, and achievements across your company, fostering a sense of community and engagement. With automated birthday and holiday message postings, Tribe ensures that your team feels valued and connected.

Productivity monitoring is made effortless with Tribe. Track website and app usage, gain insights into productivity across different categories, and effectively manage employee leave.
