    <h3>
      Banking & Financial Solutions
    </h3>

    <p>
      Present-day challenges faced by financial institutions include a
      combination of ever-changing customer expectations, newer regulations,
      security, & privacy issues as well as competition from new age technology
      companies. All this has resulted in rising cost pressures, challenge in
      meeting profitability objectives, and a somewhat delayed response to
      business needs on account of operational and structural issues. Keeping
      financial goals in mind, FI’s are now striving to be a key facilitator to
      their customer transactions either as their primary banker or silently in
      the background providing an ecosystem of engagement for their customers.
      We are also seeing Open Banking across regions to be a strong driver of
      engagement between established banks and the new age FinTech, thereby
      creating a win-win partnership for both. Broad level dimensions of
      internal change within FI’s include IT strategy, shifting expenditure
      patterns, culture-led newer operating model, and a much more evolved
      delivery model.

    <h3>Hospitality</h3>
    <p>
      The Hospitality Industry is going through unprecedented challenges. The
      uncontrollable variables that impact the Hospitality industry whether it
      be the economic slowdown, the global political situation, policies,
      disruptive new business models, or the recent virus pandemic push
      hospitality companies to constantly reinvent itself in order to recover,
      gain and maintain a competitive advantage. Hence retaining guests and
      ensuring increased repeat business is paramount. Delivering an integrated
      and personalized guest experience across all channels, while increasing
      efficiencies by streamlining operations, and leveraging new channels for
      sales will help the Hospitality sector maximize its revenue potential.
      This can only happen when Hospitality companies start using guest data to
      draw meaningful insights and deliver consistent and personalized
      experiences at each Guest Touchpoint in real-time.
