      <h2>What Is Personal Data at Apple?</h2>
      <p>
        At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that
        those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live
        in the world. That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified
        or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by
        Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives. This
        means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is
        personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but
        that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number
        of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered
        non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy
        Policy covers how Apple or an Apple-affiliated company (collectively,
        “Apple”) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our
        websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in
        person (including by phone or when visiting our retail stores). Apple
        may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps
        available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not
        apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We
        encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy
        rights before interacting with them.
      </p>
      <h2>Your Privacy Rights at Apple</h2>
      <p>
        At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer,
        restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have
        provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to
        exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a
        discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple.
        Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal
        data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
        To exercise your privacy rights and choices including where a
        third-party service provider is acting on Apple’s behalf, visit the
        Apple Data and Privacy page at privacy.apple.com for Apple or
        shazam.com/privacy for Shazam. To help protect the security of your
        personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will
        be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not
        currently available from privacy.apple.com, you can make a request at
        apple.com/legal/privacy/contact. There may be situations where we cannot
        grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your
        transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that
        transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request
        where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud
        and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account
        that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your
        privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of
        others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical. If
        you live in California and you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy
        page, you or your authorized agent can make a request at
        apple.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273. For more
        information on exercising your rights, visit
        support.apple.com/kb/HT208501.

        Apple’s Use of Personal Data
      </h2>
      <p>
        Apple uses personal data to power our services, to process your
        transactions, to communicate with you, for security and fraud
        prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for
        other purposes with your consent. Depending on the circumstance, Apple
        may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to
        fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or those of
        other persons, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal
        data where we believe it is in our or others’ legitimate interests,
        taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. More
        information is available in the product-specific information embedded in
        our products and features as described above. If you have questions
        about the legal basis, you can contact the Data Protection Officer at
        apple.com/legal/privacy/contact. Power Our Services. Apple collects
        personal data necessary to power our services, which may include
        personal data collected to improve our offerings, for internal purposes
        such as auditing or data analysis, or for troubleshooting. For example,
        if you would like to access a song through an Apple Music subscription,
        we collect data on what songs you play in order to provide you with the
        content requested and for royalty purposes. Process Your Transactions.
        To process transactions, Apple must collect data such as your name,
        purchase, and payment information. Communicate with You. To respond to
        communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account,
        market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or
        request information or feedback. From time to time, we may use your
        personal data to send important notices, such as communications about
        purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because
        this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may
        not opt out of receiving these important notices. Security and Fraud
        Prevention. To protect individuals, employees, and Apple and for loss
        prevention and to prevent fraud, including to protect individuals,
        employees, and Apple for the benefit of all our users, and prescreening

        child sexual exploitation material. Personal Data Used for
        Personalization. If you choose to personalize your services or
        communications where such options are available, Apple will use
        information that we collect so that we can offer you those personalized
        services or communications. You can learn more about how relevant
        services use information to personalize your experience by reviewing the
        privacy information presented when you first use a service that asks to
        use your personal data. We make this information easy to find by
        presenting it with our Data & Privacy icon; it's also available at all

        Comply with Law. To comply with applicable law — for example, to satisfy
        tax or reporting obligations, or to comply with a lawful governmental
        request. Apple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision
        that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for human
        review. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for
        any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit
        processing according to California law. Apple retains personal data only
        for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was
        collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or in our
        service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. We will retain
        your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes
        outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy
        summaries. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine
        whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if
        retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest
        possible period permissible under law.
